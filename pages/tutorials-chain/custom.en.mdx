# How to customize your App Chain

This guide will walk you through the process of customizing a Madara client for your specific App Chain needs.

## Quick start tutorial

As an introduction to the following section, we created a video tutorial to give you more context on how to customize your Madara App Chain.

  We recommend continuing with the [Next Section](#step-by-step-tutorial), which will help you better understand the different components of Madara customization.

    This tutorial assumes that you already know how to launch a Madara App Chain. For more information about how to launch a Madara App Chain, please head up to [this tutorial](/tutorials-chain/how).

### Configure your Madara client

Now that you have your client installed and running smoothly in sequencer mode, you may want to configure it further to match your desired setup or network. There are two types of configuration for your node:

- **Node Configuration**: the configuration of your node itself as a sequencer engine.
- **Chain Configuration**: the configuration of the chain you are currently running your node on.

In this tutorial, we'll focus on a simple configuration of your App Chain manipulating only the Chain Configuration (for advanced Node configuration please visit the [Configuration](fundamentals/configuration) section of the Node Operator section).

Here, we will simply imagine that our node wants to launch a Starknet clone App Chain with the following configuration:

```yml
chain_name: "Starklone"
chain_id: "SN_KLONE"
native_fee_token_address: "0x012345a0fc34fa1af16a1cdee98ffb20c31f5cd61d6ab07201858f4287c938d"
parent_fee_token_address: "0x012346570d4e46f48e99674bd3fcc84644ddd6b96f7c741b1562b82f9e004dc7"
latest_protocol_version: "0.13.2"
block_time: "30s"
pending_block_update_time: "2s"
execution_batch_size: 16
bouncer_config:
block_max_capacity:
    builtin_count:
    add_mod: 18446744073709551615
    bitwise: 18446744073709551615
    ecdsa: 18446744073709551615
    ec_op: 18446744073709551615
    keccak: 18446744073709551615
    mul_mod: 18446744073709551615
    pedersen: 18446744073709551615
    poseidon: 18446744073709551615
    range_check: 18446744073709551615
    range_check96: 18446744073709551615
    gas: 5000000
    n_steps: 40000000
    message_segment_length: 18446744073709551615
    n_events: 18446744073709551615
    state_diff_size: 131072
sequencer_address: "0x01234a1bd84444c89232ec27754698e5d2e7e1a7f1539f12027f28b23ec9f3d8"
eth_core_contract_address: "0xc662c410C0ECf747543f5bA90660f6ABeBD9C8c4"
eth_gps_statement_verifier: "0x47312450B3Ac8b5b8e247a6bB6d523e7605bDb60"
```

You simply need to take this configuration and save it as a `.yml` file somewhere on your machine, then call it via:

- **`--chain-config-path <CHAIN CONFIG FILE PATH>`**: Specifies the chain configuration file path.

Which in our case would give the following command:

```bash
cargo run --release -- \
--name Madara \
--sequencer
--base-path /var/lib/madara \
--l1-endpoint ${ETHEREUM_API_URL} \
--chain-config-path "/path/to/your/config.yml"
```

Another way to run this configuration would have been, for example, to override the elements that differ here with the original Starknet mainnet configuration using:

- **`--preset <PRESET NAME>`**: Uses a preset as the chain configuration.
  - Possible values: `mainnet`, `sepolia`, `integration`, `devnet`

- **`--chain-config-override <OVERRIDES>`**: Overrides specific chain configuration parameters.

This would give the following command:

```bash
cargo run --release -- \
--name Madara \
--sequencer \
--preset mainnet \
--base-path /var/lib/madara \
--l1-endpoint ${ETHEREUM_API_URL} \
--rpc-port 9945 \
--rpc-cors '*' \
--rpc-external \
--chain-config-override chain_name="Starklone" chain_id="SN_KLONE" native_fee_token_address="0x012345a0fc34fa1af16a1cdee98ffb20c31f5cd61d6ab07201858f4287c938d" parent_fee_token_address="0x049d36570d4e46f48e99674bd3fcc84644ddd6b96f7c741b1562b82f9e004dc7" sequencer_address="0x01234a1bd84444c89232ec27754698e5d2e7e1a7f1539f12027f28b23ec9f3d8"
```

You now know how to customize your App Chain! To learn more about customizing your client, visit the sections [Node Configuration](/fundamentals/configuration) and [Chain Configuration](/chain-configuration/parameters).
