# Radius Overview

[Radius](https://theradius.xyz) is a shared sequencing layer that helps rollups decentralize and operate with a more sustainable economic approach. 

Encryption is a key component of Radius. By implementing an encrypted mempool on Madara, Radius disempowers the centralized sequencer and their ability to engage in malicious frontrunning, sandwiching, and censorship activities on StarkNet appchains. Written in Rust, the encrypted mempool uses delay encryption and secure cryptography to ensure the fair ordering of transactions, creating a safe environment that benefits the ecosystem. 

Together with Madara, Radius will accelerate rollup decentralization and enhance the benefits that Madara offers in scaling blockchains.

# Roadmap

**Phase 1. Encrypted Mempool on Madara**

During this initial phase, Radius will implement encrypted mempool on Madara to protect the users of Madara appchains from harmful MEV and censorship risks. This implementation can be used independently of the external sequencing layer (below).

**Phase 2. Sequencing Layer for Madara Appchains**

During the second phase, Radius will provide pallets to integrate Madara appchains with the Radius external sequencing layer. 

**Phase 3. Cross-rollup Interoperability**

The third and final phase is focused on enabling cross-rollup interoperability. To address the challenges of rollup silos and fragmentation, appchains integrated with the external sequencing layer will be able to leverage the functionalities of the shared sequencer: cross-rollup arbitrage and messaging.
