# Installing Madara

In this section, we will guide you through the build and run process so that you can run your own Madara client, and query the Starknet blockchain as smoothly as possible.

We want anyone to be able to launch a Madara full node, which is why we've divided this section into 3 difficulty levels:

- [**Low-level**](#low-level-installation-from-source) (from source directly building the rust binary locally)
- [**Mid-level**](#mid-level-installation) (from Docker **recomanded** via the available docker images)
- [**High-level**](#high-level-installation-clicknplay) (from an high-level interactive menu)

    This installation process will help you build the binary directly from the source code locally on your machine.
    <Steps>
    ### Install dependencies

    We first need to make sure you have everything needed to complete this tutorial.

    | Dependency        | Version              | Installation                                                                              |
    | ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Rust              | rustc 1.78           | `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs sh`                            |
    | Clang             | Latest               | `sudo apt-get install clang`                                                              |
    | Scarb             | v2.8.2               | `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh \| sh ` |

    ### Get code

    Fetch the code from the Official [Madara](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/madara) repository in the folder of your choice.

    ```bash
    cd <your-destination-path>
    git clone https://github.com/madara-alliance/madara .
    ```

    ### Build program

    Then let's build the dependencies. You can choose between 3 differents build modes:

    - **Debug** (fastest build mode, but lower performances, for testing purpose only)

    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```

    - **Release** (the recomanded build mode)

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

    - **Production** (the recomanded build mode for production performances)

    ```bash
    cargo build --profile=production
    ```

    ### Run Madara

    This command will start the Madara client with a basic set arguments which will begin the basic deployment depending on your choosed mode:

        ```bash
          cargo run --release -- \
            --name Madara \
            --full
            --base-path /var/lib/madara \
            --network mainnet \
            --l1-endpoint ${ETHEREUM_API_URL}
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab>
        ```bash
          cargo run --release -- \
            --name Madara \
            --sequencer
            --base-path /var/lib/madara \
            --preset test \
            --l1-endpoint ${ETHEREUM_API_URL}
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab>
        ```bash
          cargo run --release -- \
            --name Madara \
            --devnet
            --base-path /var/lib/madara \
            --preset test
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    This is the recomanded way to easily install and run Madara as it only requires a terminal access and Docker installed.

    <Steps>

    ### Install Docker

    {/* prettier-ignore */}

    <Tabs items={["MacOS", "Linux", "Windows"]}>
      <Tab>
        **MacOS**: To install Docker on MacOS, follow these steps: 1. Visit the
        [Docker
        Hub](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac/) and
        download Docker Desktop for Mac. 2. Open the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag
        the Docker icon to your Applications folder to begin the installation. 3.
        Once installed, launch Docker from your Applications folder. Docker will
        request your admin password to complete the setup. 4. After installation,
        you can open a terminal and run `docker --version` to verify that Docker has
        been installed successfully.
      </Tab>
      <Tab>
        **Linux**: Docker installation on Linux varies by distribution, but here are
        the general steps: 1. Update your package manager index by running `sudo
        apt-get update` (This command is for distributions using `apt` like Ubuntu
        or Debian). 2. Install prerequisite packages which allow `apt` to use
        packages over HTTPS: `sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
        ca-certificates curl software-properties-common`. 3. Add Docker's official
        GPG key: `curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo
        apt-key add -`. 4. Verify that you now have the key with the fingerprint by
        searching for the last 8 characters of the fingerprint. 5. Set up the Docker
        repository by running `sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64]
        https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"`. 6.
        Update the `apt` package index again: `sudo apt-get update`. 7. Install
        Docker: `sudo apt-get install docker-ce`. 8. To verify Docker is installed
        correctly, run `docker run hello-world`. Note: The above commands are
        tailored for Ubuntu. Please adjust for your particular Linux distribution.
      </Tab>
      <Tab>
        **Windows**: To install Docker on Windows, ensure you meet the following
        requirements: - Windows 10 64-bit: Pro, Enterprise, or Education (Build
        15063 or later). - Hyper-V and Containers Windows features must be enabled.
        Here are the steps: 1. Visit the [Docker
        Hub](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/)
        to download Docker Desktop for Windows. 2. Run the downloaded Docker Desktop
        installer. 3. Follow the installation instructions. You might be prompted to
        logout and log back in, or reboot your computer before you can use Docker.
        4. After installation, run Docker by searching for it in the Start menu and
        selecting Docker Desktop. 5. To verify Docker has been installed, open a
        command prompt and enter `docker --version`. Note: If your system does not
        support Hyper-V or if you are running Windows 10 Home, you may need to
        install Docker Toolbox instead.

    ### Run docker image

    Once you have successfully installed Docker, you can now run Madara using the images available here: [Madara-v0.1.0-nightly](https://link).
    You can replace the `--rpc-port`, `--base-path` with your desired parameters.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      This is a default configuration. For more information on possible
      configurations, please visit the
      [Configuration](../fundamentals/configuration) section.
    </Callout>

    <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
      Make sure to change the volume `-v` of your container if you change the
      `--base-path`.
    </Callout>

    ```bash
    docker run -d \
      --name Madara
      -p 9944:9944 \
      -v /var/lib/madara:/var/lib/madara \
      madara:latest \
      --base-path /var/lib/Madara \
      --network main \
      --l1-endpoint ${ETHEREUM_API_URL}
    ```

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      If you don't have an L1 endpoint url we recomand you to head up to the
      [Verification](/) section to get one
    </Callout>

    ### Check logs

    ```bash
    docker logs -f madara
    ```

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      Now you can head up to the [Metrics](/) section to easily deploy a Grafana and
      Prometheus dashboard
    </Callout>

    </Steps>

    ## Using Docker Compose

    <Steps>

    ### Prerequisites

    Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. You can follow the installation instructions for Docker in the previous section.

    ### Prepare the Environment

    Ensure you have the necessary environment variable `ETHEREUM_API_URL` set. You can set this in your shell or in a `.env` file in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file:

    ```bash
    export ETHEREUM_API_URL="your-ethereum-api-url"
    ```

    Or create a `.env` file:

    ```
    ETHEREUM_API_URL=your-ethereum-api-url
    ```

    <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
      When running with `sudo`, environment variables set in the current session might not be carried over. You can pass the variable directly to sudo using the `-E` option to preserve the environment:
    </Callout>

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      If you don't have an L1 endpoint url we recomand you to head up to the
      [Verification](/) section to get one
    </Callout>

    ### Build and Run the Container

    Navigate to the cloned Madara repository containing your `docker-compose.yml` file and run the following command to build and start the Madara client:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    This command will build the Docker image and start the container in detached mode.

    ### Check Logs

    You can view the logs of the running Madara service using the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f Madara
    ```

  <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Now you can head up to the [Metrics](/) section to easily deploy a Grafana and
    Prometheus dashboard
