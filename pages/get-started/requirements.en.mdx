# System Requirements

### Supported Operating Systems

Madara is designed to work seamlessly on a variety of modern _64-bit_ operating systems. Our support encompasses but is not limited to:

	<Tab>
		**Linux**
			- Alpine (3.15 and newer)
			- CentOS (Stream 8 and newer)
			- Debian (10 and newer)
			- Fedora (37 and newer)
			- openSUSE (15.4 and newer)
			- RHEL (8 and newer)
			- SLES (15 and newer)
			- Ubuntu (18.04 and newer)
	</Tab>
	<Tab>
		**MacOs**:
		- 10.15 Catalina and newer
	</Tab>
	<Tab>
		**Windows**
			- Windows 10 and newer

  Madara does not currently support the AArch64 (ARM64) architecture for
  Windows.

### Hardware Requirements

For optimal performance of Madara, the following hardware configurations are recommended:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={['Full Node', 'Sequencer', 'Devnet']}>
	<Tab>
		| Network               | Memory | CPU Cores |
		| --------------------- | :----: | :-------: |
		| **Mainnet**           |  16 GB |     8     |
		| **Testnet (Sepolia)** |  8 GB  |     4     |
		| **Appchains**         |  8 GB  |     4     |
	</Tab>
	<Tab>
		We advise you to use the same specs as for Starknet mainnet as mentioned in the Full Node section, but depending on your app chain traffic these figures may increase for better performance.

### Disk Requirements

The Madara client uses a [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/) key-value storage.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={['Full Node', 'Sequencer', 'Devnet']}>
	<Tab>
		A Madara Full Node requires at least **300 GB** (for Starknet Mainnet state at height 700k) of fast disk storage, such as NVMe or a high-speed SSD, to function properly. We recommend **512 GB** for reduced maintenance and greater peace of mind.

  Please note that those informations can vary a lot based on the network you are currently running.

#### Database Growth

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
	Since the state of your network keeps growing, it is important to plan for slightly more storage than necessary to avoid maintenance.
</Callout>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={['Full Node', 'Sequencer', 'Devnet']}>
	<Tab>
		Upon a fresh synchronization with Starknet mainnet, Madara requires around **300 GB** of disk space, and this requirement will increase as the blockchain expands. Post-sync, expect the database to grow by approximately **2 GB** weekly. To manage this, periodic resyncing or pruning may be necessary. A larger disk reduces the frequency of this maintenance, providing a buffer for chain growth.

#### Disk Speed

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={['Full Node', 'Sequencer', 'Devnet']}>
	<Tab>
		For Madara nodes, disk speed is a critical performance factor. We recommend using disks with a minimum of 10,000 IOPS for read and write operations to avoid sync bottlenecks and ensure swift operation.

#### Sync Modes and Disk Usage

The sync mode selected for Madara can greatly affect disk usage:

- **Full Node:** Synchronizes from the genesis of the desired network, downloads the entire state (without receipts), and allows limited storage proof access which makes it lighter.
- **Archive Node:**  Not available on Madara nodes yet, syncs from the genesis of the desired network, the slowest way to sync the network, serves all storage proofs and requires heavy storage usage.
