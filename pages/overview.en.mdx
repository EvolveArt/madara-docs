# Chain Operators

Welcome to the Chain Operators section of the Madara documentation, your comprehensive resource for running and customizing your Madara App Chain.

Here, we will help you install and configure your Madara client to best meet your needs. We wanted to make this documentation accessible to everyone, so we divided it into several levels ranging from low to high, and covers different ways of launching your Madara client: **Sequencer**, **Full Node**, and **Devenet**.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This section is intended to configure your node to participate in or launch
  your own network. To configure your own App Chain, you should head up to the
  [Chain Operator](/overview) section.
