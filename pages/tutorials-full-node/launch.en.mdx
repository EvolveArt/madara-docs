# How to launch a Madara Full Node

This guide will walk you through the process of installing and launching a Madara Full Node.

## Quick start tutorial

As an introduction to the following section, we created a video tutorial to give you more context how to launch your Madara Full Node.

  We recommend continuing with the [Next Section](#Step-by-step-tutorial), which
  will help you better understand the different components of Madara by building
  from source.

## Step by step tutorial

### Install your Full Node

<Steps>
    ### Install dependencies

    We first need to make sure you have everything needed to complete this tutorial.

    | Dependency        | Version              | Installation                                                                              |
    | ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Rust              | rustc 1.78           | `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs sh`                            |
    | Clang             | Latest               | `sudo apt-get install clang`                                                              |
    | Scarb             | v2.8.2               | `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh \| sh ` |

    ### Get code

    Fetch the code from the Official [Madara](https://github.com/madara-alliance/madara) repository in the folder of your choice.

    ```bash
    cd <your-destination-path>
    git clone https://github.com/madara-alliance/madara .
    ```

    ### Build program

    Then let's build the dependencies. You can choose between 3 different build modes:

    - **Debug** (fastest build mode, but lower performances, for testing purpose only)

    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```

    - **Release** (the recommend build mode)

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

    - **Production** (the recommend build mode for production performances)

    ```bash
    cargo build --profile=production
    ```

    ### Run Madara

    This command will start the Madara client with a basic set arguments synchronizing directly with Starknet mainnet. For further configuration we recommend you to head up to the [Configure Your Node](#configure-your-node) section down below.

    ```bash
        cargo run --release -- \
        --name Madara \
        --full
        --base-path /var/lib/madara \
        --network mainnet \
        --l1-endpoint ${ETHEREUM_API_URL}
    ```

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      If you don't have an L1 endpoint url we recommend you to head up to the
      [Verification](/) section to get one
