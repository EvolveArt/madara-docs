## Use Braavos in Madara
Braavos includes the Mainnet, Sepolia, and Goerli networks by default, but establishing interaction with your local Madara chain requires manual configuration. This involves adding a custom network within Braavos's settings.

### Configuring Argent X for Madara
1. Open the Argent X wallet and navigate to the network tab.

Once you have added Madara as a network, you can now connect to it however your Starknet wallet still needs to be deployed before its ready to be used.


### Deploying your Starknet wallet
While creating an Argent X wallet generates a Starknet address, it remains undeployed until an initial transaction triggers its activation. This means the address can passively receive funds even prior to activation, but outgoing transactions and full functionality remain unavailable.

The activation process occurs upon your first transaction from the Argent X wallet. This transaction creates and deploys your personal smart contract on the network and requires a one time fee.
