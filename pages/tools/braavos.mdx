## Use Braavos with Madara

</Steps>
Once you have added Madara as a network, you can now connect to it however your Starknet wallet still needs to be deployed before its ready to be used.

### Deploying your Starknet wallet
Upon creation, an Braavos wallet generates a Starknet address. However, this address exists in an "undeployed" state until you initiate your first transaction. 

Braavos manages the activation process under the hood; your first outgoing transaction acts as the trigger.
This transaction initiates the creation and deployment of your personal smart contract on the Madara chain.  This deployment incurs a one-time fee.
