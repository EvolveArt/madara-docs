# Starknet.js Overview
[Starknet.js](https://www.starknetjs.com/) is a lightweight JavaScript/TypeScript library enabling interaction between your DApp and Starknet. Starknet.js allows you to interact with Starknet accounts, providers, and contracts.

## Installing Starknet.js
Follow the official Starknet.js installation instructions: https://www.starknetjs.com/docs/guides/intro

## Use Starknet.js in Madara
Starknet.js provides a high-level abstraction, streamlining common tasks like contract management, account interactions, and transaction processing.

### Configuring Starknet.js for Madara
Starknet.js functions as a layer between your dApp and the Madara network. It creates providers that abstract contract deployments, account management, and transaction execution. 

When run using the --dev flag, Madara provides predeployed accounts, loaded with test token for development and testing. Use them directly with contracts or fund your Argent X/Braavos wallet. 

Connecting to your running Madara node requires just the RPC URL
```javascript
const provider = new starknet.RpcProvider({
  nodeUrl: "http://localhost:9944",
});
```
Initialising your Madara account within your application is straightforward as well, allowing interaction with smart contracts and transactions on the Madara network.
```javascript
const account = new starknet.Account(
  provider,
  "0x4",    // 0x4 is one of the predeployed account 
  "0x1234", // Any valid string can be passed as the private key for the 0x4 address
  "1",  // "1" is an identifier for Cairo 1.0 accounts
);

async function transfer(to) {
  const contract = new starknet.Contract(ERC20.abi, eth_address, provider);
  let result = contract.populate("transfer", {
    recipient: to,
    amount: {
      low: 1e20,
      high: 0,
    },
  });

  let hash = await account.execute(result, undefined);
}
```
