# Starknet.js Overview

[Starknet.js](https://www.starknetjs.com/) is a lightweight JavaScript/TypeScript library enabling interaction between your DApp and Starknet. Starknet.js allows you to interact with Starknet accounts, providers, and contracts.

## Installing Starknet.js

Follow the official Starknet.js installation instructions: https://www.starknetjs.com/docs/guides/intro

## Configuring Starknet.js for Madara

Connecting to your running Madara node requires you to point your provider to the Madara RPC url.

```javascript
const provider = new starknet.RpcProvider({
  nodeUrl: "http://localhost:9944",
});
```

You can now use this provider to interact with the chain as explained in the Starknet.js [docs](https://www.starknetjs.com/docs/guides/intro).

When run using the `--dev` flag, Madara provides predeployed accounts, loaded with the fee token for development and testing. These should be printed on the console
during node start. Use them directly with contracts or fund your Argent X/Braavos wallet.

Initialising your Madara account within your application is straightforward as well, allowing interaction with smart contracts and transactions on the Madara network.

```javascript
const account = new starknet.Account(
  provider,
  "0x4", // 0x4 is one of the predeployed account
  "0x1234", // Any valid string can be passed as the private key for the 0x4 address
  "1", // "1" is an identifier for Cairo 1.0 accounts
);

async function transfer(to) {
  const contract = new starknet.Contract(ERC20.abi, eth_address, provider);
  let result = contract.populate("transfer", {
    recipient: to,
    amount: {
      low: 1e20,
      high: 0,
    },
  });

  let hash = await account.execute(result, undefined);
}
```

[Karnot](https://karnot.xyz) has also developed ready to use scripts using Starknet.js to fund wallets, declare and deploy contracts and some other
useful tasks. You can refer to them [here](https://github.com/karnotxyz/madara-get-started).
