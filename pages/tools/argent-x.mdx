# Argent X Overview

[Argent X](https://www.argent.xyz/argent-x/) is an open-source Starknet wallet.

## Installing Argent X

Follow the official Argent X installation instructions:<br></br>
`https://www.argent.xyz/learn/how-to-create-an-argent-x-wallet/`

## Use Argent X with Madara

Argent X includes the Mainnet, Sepolia, and Goerli networks by default, but connecting with your local Madara chain requires manual configuration. This involves adding a custom network within Argent X's settings.

### Configuring Argent X for Madara

<Steps>
### Open the Argent X wallet and navigate to Settings.

### Click the plus button on the top right to add a network.

### Fill in the following fields:
    1. **Network Name**: A friendly name for the Madara network.
    2. **Chain ID**: The default chain ID on Madara is `SN_GOERLI`, to add a custom chain ID, refer to the Configure section of Madara documentation<br></br><br></br>
            If you want to verify the chain ID, follow these steps:<br></br>
            1.  Execute the following POST request using a tool like curl to retrieve the chain ID from your remote Madara node (replace http://localhost:9944 with the appropriate remote endpoint URL).           
                ``` bash
                    curl --location 'http://localhost:9944' \
                    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
                    --data '{
                        "id": 0,
                        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
                        "method": "starknet_chainId",
                        "params": {}
                    }'
                ```
            2.  The response will be a JSON object containing the chain ID in the "result" field. For example: 
                ``` bash
                    {
                        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
                        "result": "0x534e5f474f45524c49",
                        "id": 0
                    }
                ```
            3.  Use an online hex converter tool (e.g., `https://stark-utils.vercel.app/converter`) to convert the provided hexadecimal value (0x534e5f474f45524c49 in this example) to a readable string representation.
            4.  Enter the converted string value in the "Chain ID" field within the Argent X network configuration.
    3. RPC URL: `http://localhost:9944`
    4. Sequencer URL: `http://localhost:9944`

### Save the new network configuration.
</Steps>

Once you have added Madara as a network, you can now connect to it.

### Deploying your Starknet wallet

Upon creation, an Argent X wallet generates a Starknet address. However, this address exists in an "undeployed" state until you initiate your first transaction.

Argent X manages the activation process under the hood; your first outgoing transaction acts as the trigger.
This transaction initiates the deployment of your personal smart contract on the Madara chain. This deployment incurs a one-time fee.
