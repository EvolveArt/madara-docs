# Starkli Overview
Starkli is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline interaction with your Madara chain. It simplifies managing accounts, deploying and interacting with smart contracts, and accessing network data.

## Installing Starkli
<Steps>
### Installing starkliup
Install Starkliup, the installer for the Starkli environment
```bash
curl https://get.starkli.sh | sh
```
Starkliup should now be installed.
Restart the terminal

### Install starkli v0.1.20
Madara currently is only compatible with starkli v0.1.20. Active development is underway to ensure the latest version is supported.
Run starkliup to install starkli v0.1.20
```bash
starkliup -v 0.1.20
```
Starkli should now be installed.
Restart the terminal

### Verify Starkli installation
```bash
starkli --version
```
The output should display
```bash
0.1.20 (e4d2307)
```
</Steps>

Starkli allows you to perform all operations on your chain without leaving the command line.
## Use Starkli in Madara
Before starting with configuring Starkli, add your Madara RPC url to the env. By default, this would be `http://localhost:9944`
```bash
export STARKNET_RPC="http://localhost:9944/"
```

### Configuring Starkli for Madara
Follow the steps in the tutorial and complete the below steps:<br></br>
`https://book.starkli.rs/tutorials/starkli-101`
1. Prepare a signer and an account
2. Compile your Cairo contract
3. Deploy your contract

To compile your Cairo contract, you need to install Scarb `0.6.1`. You can use asdf for the same.
`https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#install-via-asdf`

On running `scarb init`, a `Scarb.toml` file is generated. Add these dependencies to your `Scarb.toml` file.
```bash
[dependencies]
starknet = ">=2.1.0"

[[target.starknet-contract]]
```
After this you can follow the tutorial to compile and deploy your contract.
