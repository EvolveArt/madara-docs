`https://book.starkli.rs/tutorials/starkli-101`
1. Prepare a signer and an account
2. Compile your Cairo contract
3. Deploy your contract

To compile your Cairo contract, you need to install Scarb `0.6.1`. You can use asdf for the same.
`https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#install-via-asdf`

On running `scarb init`, a `Scarb.toml` file is generated. Add these dependencies to your `Scarb.toml` file.
```bash
[dependencies]
starknet = ">=2.1.0"

[[target.starknet-contract]]
```
After this you can follow the tutorial to compile and deploy your contract.
