# The Madara Stack

![madara_logo](../static/img/madara_logomark_red.png)

**Madara is an open source framework that allows you to build your own app chain powered by Cairo.**

Madara is built on a fork of the [Substrate Framework](https://substrate.io/) which has been battle tested and used in production for multiple years now. It secures biillions of dollars on
chains like Polkadot, Moonbeam and Astar. To execute Cairo smart contracts, Madara makes use of the [Cairo VM](https://github.com/lambdaclass/cairo-rs) and
the [blockifier](https://github.com/starkware-libs/blockifier) both of which are used in production by Starknet.
It leverages the power of Cairo to make any program execution actually provable. Madara is a generalized framework to build an app chain and can be used to build
L2s/L3s and sovereign/validity/validium rollups.

## Why build an app chain?

While there are multiple reasons why you should build an app chain as stated below, most of the reasons boild down to sovereignity. This doesn't refer to Sovereign rollups as defined
[here](https://celestia.org/learn/sovereign-rollups/an-introduction/) (which is a novel idea in itself!). Instead it refers to sovereignity of your tech stack.

You get to choose precisely what tech runs your chain - account abstraction, alternative DA layers, new op codes and the list goes on. You're in complete control just how it
works in the web2 world. Noone forces you to use a specific version of Rust or limits you to SQL databases only. You can choose what tech works best for your application and build accordingly.

The best signal for the need of app chains is the long list of [EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/all) that exist on Ethereum. There are several EIPs that we know are better for the protocol, however, getting them on mainnet
can take years. And that's a feature not a bug! However, this doesn't mean that you need to wait for years before you launch your app. Frameworks like Madara allow you to launch an app chain that
uses ZK to leverage the security of Ethereum and at the same time provides complete flexibility to innovate at the technical front.

While there are no boundaries to what's possible on an app chain, some common ideas and advantages are

1. New op codes in the VM or using a different VM altogether
2. Native account abstraction
3. Custom fee token or no fees at all
4. Alternative DA layers to save on fees
5. Faster throughput and no need to compete for blockspace
6. Custom logic at the protocol level
7. And many more!

## Pioneers of the app chain technology

Starkware fostered the vision of app chain scaling as early as [2021](https://medium.com/starkware/fractal-scaling-from-l2-to-l3-7fe238ecfb4f). In fact, Cairo was one of the earliest
ZK techs which has been used to scale Ethereum. It has been used in production by the likes of dYdX, Immutable, Sorare, Starknet and many other chains for multiple years making it the
most battle tested technology for ZK scaling. Today, Cairo secures more than $700 million and has been used to trade more than $1 trillion.

Previosuly, the only way to deploy Cairo chains was to do it via StarkEx which was a closed source solution provided by Starkware. However, we are now changing that with Madara. Madara,
as mentioned, is an open source framework that allows you to build app chains that leverage the power of Cairo and the Starknet technology.
