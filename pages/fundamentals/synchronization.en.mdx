# Synchronization

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This section is about Full Nodes synchronization only. Starknet doesn't have
  P2p yet, Full Nodes synchronize trough the FGW, check the [FGW
  section](#syncing-from-the-fgw) down bellow for more information.
</Callout>

## Synchronization modes

- Snap Sync
  - Available using the **`--snap <BLOCK_NUMBER>`** command
  - The fastest way to sync to the desired network
  - Download the same state as full sync but starts from the desired and available snapshots
  - It is less secure than full sync (please only use snapshots from trusted parties)
- Full Sync
  - Sync from the genesis of the desired network
  - Slower than snap sync
  - Downloads the entire state (without receipts)
  - Allows a limited storage proof access
- Archive Sync
  - Not available on Madara nodes yet
  - Sync from the genesis of the desired network
  - The slowest way to sync the desired network
  - Heavy storage usage
  - Serves all storage proofs

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Syncing a node in Full or Snap sync doesn't means you don't have access to
  receipts, those are re-executed and generated internally by the node when
  required.
</Callout>

## Additional modes

They're some additional modes you may want to use when syncing a Madara instance, for example for dev purposes

- Disable state root
  - Available using the **`--disable-root`** command
  - Doesn't compute commitments
  - Syncs more than 3x faster than a Full Sync
  - The fastest way to sync to the desired network (yes we lied above :)

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Syncing a node in `--disable-root` means that you're not verifying the
  integrity of the state you're currently syncing. Only do it if you're aware of
  what you're doing.
</Callout>

## Syncing from the FGW
