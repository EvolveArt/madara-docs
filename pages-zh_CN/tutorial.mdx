# Introduction to creating DApps with Madara

This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide on building decentralized applications on Madara. The tutorial covers everything you need to get started, from writing secure smart contracts using Cairo, Starknet's dedicated language, to deploying your smart contract to your own Madara app chain. You'll also learn how to set up and run your own Madara node and build a user-friendly frontend application using Next.js, StarknetKit, and Starknet.js libraries. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to create powerful and scalable DApps that leverage the capabilities of the Madara network.
